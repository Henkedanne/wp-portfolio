        <p class="about-content__text">I'm currently a student at Hyper Island in Stockholm where I attend the Digital Media Creative Program. I love to make things on the web. I think it's a great platform for getting products or "thingymathings" out in public. And to actually be able to influence a user with my work is such a cool thing. <br> I'm currently looking for internship and I would like to find a space where I can grow my skills in web-development and design.</p>
