Create an class overlay with fat font
When you hover over a link on the right side. Then the class overlay should be added. 



// How do I create a unique footer class for the css. so that I can style the footer seperatly in the page.php??? SOLVED! (I made a new template page called page-footer.php and made a .page-footer class and removed the margin.) //

Add a "faint" background that moves when you move the mouse. OR it scrolls very slowly.
